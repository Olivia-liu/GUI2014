1)
To find and replace every instance of the word fun with amazing, 
:%s/fun/amazing/g

To replace only the first instance of fun with amazing in each line,
:%s/fun/amazing/

To replace the whole words which exactly match "fun" with "amazing",
:%s/\<fun\>/amazing/g (every occurance)
or
:%s/\<fun\>/amazing/ (only first occurance in each line)

Java Question:
5) 
Static means you don't have to create an object to call the method. 

For example, you can write a method which
can be used to get the bigger integer out of two integers(assume that the numbers passed in are different), and the method is in the IntegerFun class. 
Inside the IntegerFun class, there's a method like this:

  public static int getTheBigger (int a, int b){
    if ( a < b ){
      return b;
    }
    else {
      return a;
    }
  }

To call the method, write sentences like this:

  int theBigger = getTheBigger( 12, 14 ); (if called from this class)
or
  int theBigger = IntegerFun.getTheBigger( 12, 14 ); (if called from another class)

Though this program is funnctional, it is unnecessarily long and repetitive. Every combination of shape and color needs an independent method, 
and those methods have much in common, so there must be a more general strategy that can handle different situations.

First of all, she can build classes hierarchy to define different shapes and corresponding drawing methods for those shapes. For example, she can have a 
abstract class Shape to defines some common properties of shapes. And this class has an abstract method public void draw( Color color ). Then she can have 
a Rectangle class which defines the properties specific for a rectangle and a concrete method public void draw( Color color ) to draw a rectangle.

When an object of a shape of any kind calls the method draw( Color color ), during runtime, java will determine what kind of shape the calling object really
is and run the draw method in the class the shape belongs to.

This is better also because we can define and pass in any custom color.
